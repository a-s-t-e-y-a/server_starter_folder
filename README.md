# Server Starter Folder

Are you tired of always creating the same structure from scratch for your projects? Me too. yawning_face

This is my go-to when I start a new project on backend-end development.

If you found it useful somehow, I would be grateful if you could leave a star in the project's GitHub repository
This repository contains a basic file structure and configuration for starting a new server-side project. It includes the following:

    config: A directory for storing configuration files, such as environment variables.
    src: A directory for storing the main source code of the project.
    test: A directory for storing test files.
